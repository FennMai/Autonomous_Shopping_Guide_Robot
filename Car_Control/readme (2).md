### boost download link: 
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html
### nlohmann download link: 
https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
### install wiringpi
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wiringpi
```

### install boost
```
cd boost_1_82_0
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local
./b2
sudo ./b2 install
// until up not keep going...
cat /usr/include/boost/version.hpp | grep "BOOST_LIB_VERSION"
// if find the error 
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

### Compile Project ÔºàCMAKEÔºâ
#### Navigate to the project root directory
```
cd backend
```
#### Create a build directory
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
#### Run CMake to generate the build system
```
cmake ..
```
#### Build the project
```
cmake --build .
```
Or
```
make
```

:exclamation: (The packaged build file has been quarantined and will not be uploaded to github ÔºÅ)
:exclamation: (The packaged Packages include boost and nlohmann file has been quarantined and will not be uploaded to github ÔºÅ)

### Run the unit test: 
```
./all_tests
```
or
```
sudo ./all_tests
```

### if running code in terminal for single file (demo): 
```
1. g++ -std=c++11 server.cpp -o server
g++ -std=c++11 -I../packages/json-develop -o server server.cpp
2. ./server
```
or
```
g++ led.cpp -o led -lpigpio -lrt -lpthread
sudo ./led
```

### websocket Method for connecting to the web end
1. To install cploar in the Raspberry PI, visit https://www.cpolar.com/
2. Run cpolar http 8022 after installationÔºö
```
cpolar http 8022
```
3. Start the web project in the remote system and configure the new WebSocket in /web/src/views/index.vue as the ip address of the cploar
```
this.ws = new WebSocket('ws://xxx.cn');
```
4. Start the Raspberry PI project
```
./run
```
5. Refresh web project
6. The connection is successful. Hardware starts.
