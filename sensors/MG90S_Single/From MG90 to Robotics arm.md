 void **moveToAngleSlowly**(float targetAngle)

> **Blocking call**: Using `usleep(20000);` will cause the calling thread to sleep, which means that if your program needs to do other things at the same time (such as reading sensor data or responding to user input), it will not be able to execute, Because the program is blocked in the loop.



void **moveMotorSequentially**(mg90s &motor1, mg90s &motor2, mg90s &motor3, mg90s &motor4)

> Asynchronous sequential control of multiple motors
